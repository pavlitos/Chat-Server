 We have chosen to do the first task.
 Question 1:
   Prevent the client from displaying the text it has sent. The server
   can do this filtering easily, but consider that the return of a text
   to the client is a valuable acknowledgement that the server actually
   delivered the text, and a diagnostic on how long it took to do so.
   Hint: you cannot rely on the client's user name string, as this can
   be set to anything on any client.

 We made the server to do the filtering. The most significant part was to keep track of who has sent the message,
 so while sending the message i did send also the object of the @sender in the RUN class and with a simple comparison
 We did the filtering.
